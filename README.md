## 100 Days of Python and Data Science

Welcome to the 100-days-of-python-and-data-science repository!

This repository is dedicated to a 100-day journey through Python programming and data science. As part of an ongoing series, I’m documenting my daily learning and practical insights from my Master’s studies in Data Science. The series includes 100 posts, each focusing on different aspects of Python, data science techniques, and real-world applications.

What You’ll Find Here:

Daily Python Tutorials: Short, hands-on tutorials that cover fundamental and advanced topics in Python programming. Each post includes code examples, explanations, and practical exercises.
Data Science Microcapsules: Insightful microcapsules of data science concepts, including data wrangling, analysis, and visualization techniques. Learn how to apply these concepts using real-world data.
API Usage Examples: Learn how to interact with various public APIs using Python’s requests library. Examples include fetching data, handling responses, and integrating external data sources into your projects.
Practical Applications: Real-life use cases and projects that demonstrate how to apply Python and data science skills. Explore how to use public online databases and APIs to solve problems and gain insights.

Repository Structure:
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for each daily post, featuring step-by-step tutorials, code snippets, and explanations.
Code Samples: Python scripts and code samples related to the blog posts and tutorials.
Resources: Links to additional resources, documentation, and public APIs used in the examples.
