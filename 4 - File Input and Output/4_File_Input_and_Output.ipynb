    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Welcome to Day 4 of our 100-Day Data Science journey! Today, we'll dive into a really important skill in programming: File Input and Output (I/O). Whether you're storing data, reading configurations, or processing large datasets, understanding how to read from and write to files is crucial.\n",
    "In this post, we'll start with handling text files in Python. Then, we'll explore a practical example of processing a CSV file containing public data about U.S. states. We'll also briefly touch on different types of files (text, binary, CSV) to give you a broader perspective."

    "## Why is File I/O Important?\n",
    "File I/O is an integral part of programming because it allows you to persist data between program runs, share data with other programs, and handle large datasets that might not fit into memory simultaneously. Being proficient in File I/O enables you to build more complex, data-driven applications.\n",
    "Real-world scenarios where file I/O is critical include:\n",
    "- Logging Data: Storing logs from applications for troubleshooting or analysis.\n",
    "- Configuration Management: Reading and writing configuration files that control how software behaves.\n",
    "- Data Analysis Pipelines: Handling large datasets efficiently by reading from and writing to files."

    "## Basic Theory: Understanding File I/O in Python\n",
    "Python provides built-in functions for working with files, allowing you to easily open, read, write, and close files. The most commonly used functions include `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening a File\n",
    "The `open()` function is used to open a file in various modes:\n",
    "- 'r' - Read mode (default)\n",
    "- 'w' - Write mode (overwrites the file)\n",
    "- 'a' - Append mode (adds to the end of the file)\n",
    "- 'b' - Binary mode (used for non-text files)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these file modes is crucial as they determine how a file is accessed:\n",
    "- Read Mode ('r'): Opens the file for reading. If the file doesn't exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "- Write Mode ('w'): Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it will be overwritten; if not, a new file will be created.\n",
    "- Append Mode ('a'): Opens the file for writing but appends data to the end instead of overwriting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Closing a File\n",
    "It's important to close files after you use them to free up system resources. This is done using the `close()` method or automatically with a `with` statement, which ensures that the file is closed when the block of code is exited."
