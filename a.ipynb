    "Today, we will start looking into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This programming approach focuses on modeling the real world by using classes and objects. This is an alternative to the more linear, step-by-step structure of procedural programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP allows developers to encapsulate data and behavior into objects, making code easier to maintain and scale. Mastering OOP is crucial for developing clean, reusable, and scalable code in complex data science and software development projects.\n",

    "Imagine you're designing a banking system. You need a way to represent each customer's account, track their balance, and perform operations like deposits and withdrawals. This is where OOP shines. Instead of writing repetitive step-by-step code that is repeated over and over again, OOP allows you to model real-world entities - like bank accounts - as classes, making your code reusable, maintainable, and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP allows you to structure your code by modeling real-world objects, making your programs easier to develop, maintain, and scale. By encapsulating data and behaviors in objects, you can create modular, reusable code components. As your projects grow in complexity, using OOP principles ensures your code remains organized and scalable.\n",
