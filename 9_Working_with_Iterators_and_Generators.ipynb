    "### Iterators:\n",
    "An iterator is an object in Python that enables one to traverse through all the elements of a collection, \n",
    "such as lists or strings. The iterator protocol in Python involves implementing two methods: `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__iter__()` method, which returns the iterator object itself, is called once; it is usually required to allow Python containers to return a fresh iterator each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__next__()` method must return the next item in the sequence and should raise a StopIteration exception when there are no more elements.\n"

A generator function automatically handles the state management, suspending and resuming its context around each yield to produce a series of values over time. This is especially useful for large datasets or infinite sequences, as it allows for the efficient consumption of parts of the data without loading everything into memory.\n"
