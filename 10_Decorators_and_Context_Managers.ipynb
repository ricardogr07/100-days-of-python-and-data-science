    "## Why Are Decorators and Context Managers Important?\n",
    "Decorators are powerful tools in Python that allow you to extend or enhance the behavior of existing functions or methods in a clean and reusable manner. They are especially useful for adding functionality like performance monitoring, access control, and logging, without modifying the original function's body. This leads to more maintainable and understandable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context managers, on the other hand, are essential for proper resource management. They provide a structured way to allocate and release resources—whether it's file streams, database connections, or network connections—when needed. By ensuring resources are released after use, context managers help prevent resource leaks and make your code safer and cleaner."
