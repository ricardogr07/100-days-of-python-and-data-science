    "# Day 12 - Data Import and Export with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Day 12 of our 100-Day Data Science journey! Today, we focus on one of the most practical aspects of working with data: importing and exporting data using Pandas. We'll cover how to read from and write to CSV files, which are among the most commonly used data formats. We'll also apply these techniques in a real-life use case by importing stock market data for analysis."

Whether you're working with local files, databases, or web data, Pandas provides versatile functions that make handling data seamless. Knowing how to manage data input and output operations allows you to focus on analysis rather than data wrangling."
